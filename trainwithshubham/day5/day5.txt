You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -
So Write a bash script create directories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is the directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates a specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.

Example 1: When the script is executed as

./createDirectories.sh day 1 90

then it creates 90 directories as day1 day2 day3 .... day90
