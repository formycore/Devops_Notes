Initialize the control-plane node, configure kubectl for a normal user, enable IP forwarding, disable swap, install Flannel CNI, and allow worker nodes to join. Include steps to reset and clean any existing kubeadm state on worker nodes, fix hostname resolution issues, and ensure kubelet and containerd services are running. Also include instructions to remove Flannel if needed and handle renaming nodes in Kubernetes."
