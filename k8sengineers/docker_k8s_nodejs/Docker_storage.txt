3 types of volumes
    - volume mount
    - bind mount
    - tempfs mount
- bind mount: entire file system on the host system can be used by containers
- volume mount: only the docker area is used by the container
- tempfs mount: the data of the container is stored in the memory not on the disk not even inside the container

-------------------------------
volume mount:
- can be controlled by API & cli
- shares the host file system under Docker root directory /var/lib/docker
- docker info (it will show the docker root directory)
- under the root directory the is directory called volumes in this we will volumes
- single volume can attched to multiple containers to share the data, like nfs (network file system)
- we can give read-only mode container cannot manipulate the volume
- used as -v , --volume or --mount 
- static and dynamic volumes can be created
- we have to provide the volume name
- use relative path
-------------------------------------
bind mount:
- we have use -v hostpath:container path
- absolute path (full path) /var, /backups
- with --mount the file or directory needs to be present in the container or host
- with -v the file or directory dont need  to be present in the container or host it will create the file or directory
- shared to multiple containers
