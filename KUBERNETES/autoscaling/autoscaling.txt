- deploy replicas
- kubectl scale deploy/app --replicas=2
- autoscalers are of three types for scaling up and down also
   - HPA - horizantal pod autoscalers
   - VPA - vertical pod autoscalers
   - CA  - cluster autoscalers


- HPA: 
    - increase the no of pod to distribute the lod
    - when ther is a spike in 
        - Memory
        - CPU
        - other metrics
    - decrease the no of pods when there is no load
    - not a best solution
    - example database connections
        - increase the database connections by increasing Memory and CPU
        - increase the resource of the pods instead of increasing the pods numbers

- VPA:
  - increase the resource of the pods not the no of pods
  - if there is no capacity in the cluster
  - it doesn't make any sense to increase the no of pods or increase the resources
  - decrease the resource when there is no load


- CA:
    - this will do the perfect job for this 
    - it will create the new node 
    - creates the nodes if the pods are stuck at pending due to lack of resource in the cluster
    - decrease the no of nodes when there is no node
