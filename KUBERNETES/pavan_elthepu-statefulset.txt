Stateful Sets(incomplete)
- problem 1
	- in the stateful set replicas should more than one for example take it as 3 pods (mongodb)
	- so 3 pods uses same pvc from pv 
	- data inconsistancy
- solution 
	- seperate pods have seperate pvcs and seperate pv 
--------------------------------
example
volumeClaimTemplate:
  - metadata:
      name: mongo-volume
	spec:
	  accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
	  storageClassName: demo-storage
	  resources:
	    requests:
		  storage: 1Gi
-----------------------------
problem -2 with using the deployment
- master node handles both read write 
- slave1 node reads
- slave2 node reads 
- master should be up and running
- from master slave1 reads 
- from slave1 slave2 reads
- load on the master reduces
- with this continously syncs the data from master to slaves
- this can be achived with stateful set
- in the stateful set pod1 is created then pod2 is created and then pod3 is created
- for deletion also the pod3 deletes first then pod2 then pod1
- 
----------------------------------------------------------------
problem 3 with deployment
- sticky identity for each node
