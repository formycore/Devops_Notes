# HELM
* this is same as yum and apt in the linux world
* it is a package manager for kubernetes
* it is a tool that streamlines installing and managing kubernetes applications
## ADVANTAGES OF HELM
* if we want to deploy an application in kubernetes, we need to create a deployment, service, ingress, configmap, secrets,volumes etc
* helm helps us to create all these resources in a single command 
* if we dont have helm then we need to create all these resources manually like creating a deployment, service, ingress, configmap, secrets, volumes etc
