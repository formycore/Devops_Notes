- stateful set is workload component
- deployments are wrapper around the pods
- pods have random names, no order in creating the pods
- pods created simuntaneously in deployments

- in statefulset 
	- pods follow naming order
	- if we specify the sts as the pod name with 3 replicas 
	- it will deployed in sts-0 , sts-1, sts-2 ..... order
	- if the sts-0 is completly running then it deploys to sts-1 and so on 
	- if the replicas value is reduced to 2 then it deletes the last created pod
	- ## try to increase the replicas count ###
	- if the pod crashes and kubernetes checks the state and it creates with the same name
