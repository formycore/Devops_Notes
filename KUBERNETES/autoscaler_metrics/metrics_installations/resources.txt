- for example there are 9 pods 
- each node has cpu=4 and memory=4 
- 4 pods are used in the each nodes so all the resources are fully utilized 
- there is not enough resources left in the nodes
- and 9th pod will be in pending with error insufficient resources, this 9th pod will not be schduled
- for pod1 if the traffic increases it will try to take the more resources
- if pod1 tries to take more resources from node than resources already present in the node
- pod1 will throughs error OOM (out of memory)
