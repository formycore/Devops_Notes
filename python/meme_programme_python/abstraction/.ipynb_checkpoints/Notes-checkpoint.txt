- if a class contains more than 1 abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract
- what is abstract method?
    if the method declared without implementation 
    - we cannot instantiate abstract class it means we cannot create object of abstract class
-------------------------
class A:
    def method(self):
        pass
obj = A()
obj.method() # ouput is empty 
------------------------------
- we need to use abc module to create abstract class
- in abc module we have ABC class, and abstractmethod
- how to use these
