if there are 4 lines and we printed first line using readline(), only first line is printed and again used second line is printed,
- read(), from the current position to the end of the file
- file = open("test.txt")
print(file.readline())
# first line is printed and again used second line is printed 
print(file.read())
# from the second line all the lines are printed
- file.close()
# this closes the file
