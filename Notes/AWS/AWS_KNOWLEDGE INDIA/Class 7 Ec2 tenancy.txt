There are 3 types tenancies
- shared tenancy
- Dedicated instances
- Dedicated hosts
STEP 3: 
		 Shared Tenancy: Shared is default model
		- in shared tenancy, the cpu can change position form one place to another instance after stop and starting the instance
		- In reboot underlying H/W does not change
Dedicated instance:
				    - no other shared tenancy model does not comes into this
				    - after stop and start it gets launched on a different host
Dedicated host:
					- Even after stop and start it will run in the same physical host
					- License for S/W or H/W
					- billing for the full physical host
					- costly among the three
