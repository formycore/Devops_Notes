    * select the deployment
    * actions (under three dots)
    * scale
    * edit replicas
    * change the replicas value
* here we can do scale up and scale down
* here we can do scale up and scale down from the console also
$ kubectl scale --replicas=1  deployment nginx-deployment
* how to change the image name in deployment
    $ kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1 --record
* check the status of the rollout of the image
    $ kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
* kubectl get deployments -- to check the deployments
* kubectl rollout history
  $ kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
* kubectl rollout undo
    $ kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment
* check for the particular rollout
    $ kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment --revision=<no of the rollout>
* from the console under the same workloads
    ** check for the revision history
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* CANARY MODE
    * used to test a new version of the deployment
    * when we have a new release of the application, we can test it in the canary mode
    * we can deploy the new version to but we dont want to expose this to the public
    * we can deploy specific region or customers or users to some users only to test and check
    if it works fine we will switch all our traffic to newer(canary) version or else we can undo/rollback this
    older version
    * to use this canary fully we need to have service mesh 
    * we will check that in further videos
    * the service will do 50 50 load balancing
* try to down scale the deployments to zero
    $ kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment nginx-deployment
* try to down scale the canary also
    $ kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment nginx-deployment-canary
