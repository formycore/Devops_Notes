Here are the steps to install Java with curl on CentOS 7:

    Open a terminal window on your CentOS 7 system.
    Update your system's package repository by running the following command:

    sql

sudo yum update

Install the curl utility by running the following command:

sudo yum install curl

Download the Java installation package using the curl utility by running the following command:

arduino

curl -LO "https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk11/9/GPL/openjdk-11.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz"

Note: This command downloads the Java 11 installation package for 64-bit Linux systems. If you need a different version or architecture of Java, you can find the appropriate download link on the official Java download page (https://jdk.java.net/).
Extract the downloaded package using the tar utility by running the following command:

tar -xvf openjdk-11.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

Move the extracted Java directory to the /usr/local directory by running the following command:

bash

sudo mv jdk-11.0.2 /usr/local/

Configure the Java environment variables by creating a new file named java.sh in the /etc/profile.d directory using the following command:

bash

sudo nano /etc/profile.d/java.sh

Add the following lines to the java.sh file:

bash

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk-11.0.2
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

Note: The JAVA_HOME variable should point to the directory where you installed Java. If you installed a different version of Java or installed it in a different directory, you should adjust the path accordingly.
Save and close the java.sh file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.
Make the java.sh file executable by running the following command:

bash

sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/java.sh

Reload the environment variables by running the following command:

bash

source /etc/profile.d/java.sh

Verify that Java is installed correctly by running the following command:

java -version

This should display the version of Java that you installed.
